# Anix Project Boilerplate

Welcome to the Anix language starter template! This boilerplate provides the essential files and structure to help you quickly start building with Anix.

## Included Files

- `main.anix` - Sample Anix source file with basic syntax and comments
- `parser.config.json` - Example parser configuration for Anix
- `README.md` - This file, with setup and usage instructions

## Getting Started

1. Copy the contents of this `template` directory into your new project folder.
2. Edit `main.anix` to start writing your Anix code.
3. Adjust `parser.config.json` as needed for your project requirements.

## Best Practices

- Follow the sample structure for consistency.
- Use comments in `.anix` files to document your code.
- Refer to the Anix documentation for advanced features.

Happy coding with Anix!
